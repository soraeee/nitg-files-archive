# nitg-files-archive
Personal archive of most of my NotITG "modfiles" (playable audiovisual-focused rhythm game levels) independently created and released from 2019 to 2021.
Does not include modfiles created collaboratively with other people.

Requires [NotITG](https://www.noti.tg/) v4.2.0 at minimum to run.
